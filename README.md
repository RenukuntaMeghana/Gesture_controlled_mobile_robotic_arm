# Gesture_controlled_mobile_robotic_arm
Designed and built a 6DOF Rover and Robotic Arm powered by Jetson Nano. The Ardupilot platform was utilized to control the movements and actions of the mobile robotic arm. Trained a Gesture Recognition Model in Python through OpenCV, Tensorflow and mediapipe and integrating it into the Robotic Arm.
